<p>The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is one of the most expensive home security cameras around, however it's also one of the most intelligent, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone variety and HDR support for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery option here, sorry-- however the camera includes a 25-foot power cable, which should assist with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
