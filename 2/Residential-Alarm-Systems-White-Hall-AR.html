<p>This awesome smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we discovered it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was identified. We enjoy that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.
