<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heater at 5am. The very first guard arrived early so he could look at the entire area and talk with me about my issues. He was professional, considerate and extremely encouraging. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took control of. When I showed up in the morning to get the event started, he was also professional, comforting and considerate. We were really pleased with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. Once after leaving our residential or commercial property in your hands, I didn't fret.</p>
