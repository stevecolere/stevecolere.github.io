<h3>House Alarm Service in Blountsville AL</h3>

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
