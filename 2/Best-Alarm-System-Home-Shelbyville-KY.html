<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership.

The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
