You could invest a comparable quantity for the best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. However, they're the very best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring. One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which might be an affordable choice for consumers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems because they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available.
