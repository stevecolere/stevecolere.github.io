We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have additional sensing units and crucial fobs, too.</p>
