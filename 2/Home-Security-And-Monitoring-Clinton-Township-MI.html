<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
