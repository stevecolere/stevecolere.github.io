<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get totally featured, professional-grade security solutions that are simple to install and easy to utilize. Honeywell Total Link cameras represent the next generation of residential video surveillance equipment. These portable cameras use motion-sensing technology that triggers them to begin recording whenever the sensors find motion. You'll then get a 10-second clip you can view via a mobile app on your smartphone or tablet-- no matter where you are. You'll understand instantly if a threat exists, so you can take instant action if required.</p>
<p>At night, though it does not have the complete IR LED range of some rivals, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple decades ago, the home security market was dominated by a few huge names offering expensive, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting agreements.
