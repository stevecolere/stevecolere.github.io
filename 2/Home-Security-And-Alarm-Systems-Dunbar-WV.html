Smart alarm changed that. Initially, standard security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, usually a home alarm company. The client paid regular monthly charges.</p>

<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, usually avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other components can easily be set up at different homes later, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too.
