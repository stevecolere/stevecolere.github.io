<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
