<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they require about four times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>

For somebody looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or somebody that desires a trained specialist to make the recommendation for the setup, expert installation is a fantastic alternative. We have actually discovered that most people that were anxious about self installing a home security system actually wound up discovering the process very simple. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially useful in this phase.</p>
