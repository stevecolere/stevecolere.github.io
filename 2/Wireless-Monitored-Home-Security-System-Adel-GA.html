<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop.
