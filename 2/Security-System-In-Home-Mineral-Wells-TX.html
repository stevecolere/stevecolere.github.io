<p>Sensors enable cameras to start and stop tape-recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is between tape-recording and finding motion. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it spots motion. They might get past the camera before it had time to record them if a nefarious bad guy was fast enough. Cellular phone can also now be used to remotely set and unset alarms via apps.</p>
<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise. Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or screen and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. If a patient is having difficulty, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is normally open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and notifies, sensors, access control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not only supplying the customer with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
