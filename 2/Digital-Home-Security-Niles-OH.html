It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.

If you dedicate to a three-year contract, the price of the Nest service drops to $19 per month. Ring's Protect Plus plan chooses $10 each month and does not require a contract.</p>
