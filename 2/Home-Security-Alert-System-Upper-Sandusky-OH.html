<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
