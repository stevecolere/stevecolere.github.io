<h3>Security Alarm System Companies in Columbia City IN</h3>
<p>There ought to be a clear line of sight between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home structure to transfer video. We attempted each of the cameras in multiple places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.
