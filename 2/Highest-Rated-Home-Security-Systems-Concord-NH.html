<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
