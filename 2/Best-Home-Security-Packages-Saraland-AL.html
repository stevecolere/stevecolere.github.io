You might spend a comparable quantity for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. But, they're the best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring.

We recommend cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
