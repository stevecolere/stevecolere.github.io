<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary worth. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is discovered. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>A larger security company that constantly monitors your home will have a designated station that views countless homes and businesses simultaneously. They cost more due to the fact that they need to go through verification with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), an independent, non-profit company that focuses on testing product and services to ensure maximum dependability and safety.
