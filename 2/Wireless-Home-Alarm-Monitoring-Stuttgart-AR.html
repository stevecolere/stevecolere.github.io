<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
