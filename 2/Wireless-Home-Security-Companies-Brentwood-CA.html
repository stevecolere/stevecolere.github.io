<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when movement was found. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
