<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
