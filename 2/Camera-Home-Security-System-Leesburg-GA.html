Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives due to the fact that their design permits minimum glare.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
