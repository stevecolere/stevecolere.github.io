The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
