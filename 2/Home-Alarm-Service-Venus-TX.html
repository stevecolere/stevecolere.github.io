<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
