<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

Home automation and control expenses around $36.99 and video services come in at $52.99. Installation and other costs may apply. Contractually, this is a 3-year agreement with a six-month trial.
