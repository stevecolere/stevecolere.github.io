If you're not ready for a dedicated security system, there are lots of private gadgets readily available that let you monitor your home from anywhere utilizing your phone or tablet, including outdoor and indoor security cameras, video doorbells, motion sensing units, and wise locks.

If the monitoring experts don't get a response from you or if they get a distress code, they'll quickly dispatch the police to check and come on you.</p>
<p>There's no devoted hub included here - each camera connects directly to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
