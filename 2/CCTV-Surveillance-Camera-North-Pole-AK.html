'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.
