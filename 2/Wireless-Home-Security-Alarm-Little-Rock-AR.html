<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
