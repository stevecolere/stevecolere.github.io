<p>Many security cameras can be used both inside your home and outdoors. They typically have the exact same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in many cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance rating are the most resilient. Because their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
