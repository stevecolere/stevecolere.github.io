The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building and construction.

Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
