From what we've seen, Deep Guard is a clear winner when it concerns proactive home security and putting a stop to criminal activity prior to it takes place. They secured our home by utilizing a state-of-the-art mix of live surveillance and AI technology. With flashing lights, two-way talk, and a blaring-loud siren, Deep Sentinel's human guards proactively monitored the perimeter of our residential or commercial property.
