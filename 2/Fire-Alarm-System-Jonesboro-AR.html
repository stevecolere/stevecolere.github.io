Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
