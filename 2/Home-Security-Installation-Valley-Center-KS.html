<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
