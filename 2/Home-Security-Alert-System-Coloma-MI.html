<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you intend to save and how long you prepare to keep documented video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

However neither can tape-record continually, and they both need the Ring Safeguard strategy to catch recordings.
