<p>Since it's more complicated than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving items if it finds an intruder; a handy intercom function that allows the device to act as a clever doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant. Security integrated with clever home automation produces the most dependable, sophisticated home security possible. It's why we establish clever home tech products and integrate with smart items from companies like Google and Amazon. A clever home is a secure home.</p>

It has to be plugged in to work-- no battery option here, sorry-- but the camera includes a 25-foot power cord, which need to aid with installation.</p>
