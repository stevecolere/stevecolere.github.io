<p>The real reason cameras are normally deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have not lowered criminal offense. "When the criminal activity and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the basic down pattern in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had lowered criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
