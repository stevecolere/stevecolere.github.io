<p>Alarm systems have become standard equipment in shops and other organisations, and they're becoming progressively typical in personal homes too. Life can get stressful sometimes, and it can be challenging keeping track of whatever around you. Luckily, a surveillance camera can provide an extra pair of eyes and serve as lookout for you and your family.

<p>Though the majority of our attention nowadays is concentrated on the transition to IP video innovation, it is essential to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly efficient for lots of surveillance applications, especially those on a budget. With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring place. However that doesn't imply you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
