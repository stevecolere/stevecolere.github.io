These companies developed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, since changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers.

<p>What's not to love about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and comes with a lots of key features we have not seen in a single camera (or at all) in the past. SimpliSafe creates and offers its own gadgets. The quality of this equipment seems satisfactory to a lot of users, though it can't be used with a different monitoring service like third-party equipment might. ADT is one of the more expensive home security companies, with pricey video monitoring and high early termination costs.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
