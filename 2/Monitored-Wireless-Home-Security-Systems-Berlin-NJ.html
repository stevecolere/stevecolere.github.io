<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
