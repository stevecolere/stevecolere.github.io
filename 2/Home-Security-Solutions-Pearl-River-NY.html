You can set the siren to follow up within 30 to 180 seconds to ideally frighten off any trespassers. Verification calls from Quick Reaction, a third-party partner service, came within 60 seconds of our 113-decibel siren (per our measurements) being set off; you can disarm it by using the app or by offering your personally chosen safe word to client service The base station also alerted us when it was disconnected from power, and it delivered on its pledge of 24 hours of battery backup.</p>
<p>It's all find and dandy to want a security cam all over in the home, however in some cases you just one that stands alone.

The Circle 2 even uses a time-lapse of the day, so you can make sure you didn't miss something.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
