<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Plus, it works with Nest items, Google Assistant and Amaxon Alexa, and the brand also uses a variety of cameras, sensing units and professional sirens, making it quite flexible.

They connect to the company's respective app, so you're constantly in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensing units cost simply $44.99 and offer three to five times more range than ADT's and Vivint's.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
