Throughout testing, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was found.

It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
