<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to police capability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  method to theft decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
