<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
