<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
