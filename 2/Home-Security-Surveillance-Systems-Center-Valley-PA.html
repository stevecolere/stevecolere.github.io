<p>Reliability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending upon which functions and benefits a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still typical grievances. Hardwired systems require minimal maintenance, and short of a basic power blackout, are harder to interfere with. Despite a general enhancement in wireless innovation, there appear to be less methods for hardwired systems to be interrupted and crippled.</p>
<p>Some companies utilize a one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter method to home security. However at Valley Alarm, we know that every circumstance is special. We customized design a security option to meet the specific requirements of each and every resident. Personalized protection: Every home is various.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
