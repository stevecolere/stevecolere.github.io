<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
