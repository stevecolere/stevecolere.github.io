<p>What lots of people do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is straight available to the public, though not found in the huge box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are classified as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these huge box chains to secure their inventory. Take a look at the ceiling of customer electronic devices shops and storage facility chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are offering to the public, and there is a good reason that.</p>

<h3>Digital Security Systems Pipe Creek TX 78063</h3>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is costly, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
