Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by.
