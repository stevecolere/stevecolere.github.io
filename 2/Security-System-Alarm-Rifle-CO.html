<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire family will love. ADT is a household name, so we frequently experiment with their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of screening, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines wail, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
<p>What we like: Allied Home Security is a local company and Brinks home security dealership that uses complimentary same day installation and complimentary activation. Their system alternatives include modern-day equipment, like doorbell cameras, and they use smart home and home automation packages on par with Fort Knox and nationwide gamers. Allied Home Security can install a new system or activate an existing system in your house.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
