The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
