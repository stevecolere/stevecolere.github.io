<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was identified. We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey.
