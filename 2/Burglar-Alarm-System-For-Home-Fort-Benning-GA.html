<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with numerous systems providing growth and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll need to manually get rid of to move the data? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
