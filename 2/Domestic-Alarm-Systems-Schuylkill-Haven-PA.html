<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, vandalism, and theft. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

Did You Know: Back in the 1980s, home security systems used to be so expensive that they were out of reach for the majority of Americans.

<p>Another method to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR).

We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.

<p>In the contemporary, with our widespread web use, we've become surprisingly lackadaisical in our method to home security.
