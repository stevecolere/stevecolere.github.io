<p>Besides resolution, likewise consider the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are developed equal. Depending on the lens' field of vision, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone. You must think about a camera with a very wide field of view if you desire to view a large area. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a fantastic possession as well.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
