<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and federal government centers, and residential consumers. After looking into 4 different security systems, we decided on SSA. They gave us the best description of their services and offered us more for the money.

There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

"As soon as the criminal offense and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the basic down trend in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
