<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential consumers. After looking into 4 various security systems, we decided on SSA. They gave us the very best description of their services and offered us more for the money.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
