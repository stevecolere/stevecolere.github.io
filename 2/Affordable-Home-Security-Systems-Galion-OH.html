<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were primarily synchronous. To achieve nearly anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when dealing with worldwide and national business. The same applies for security and video surveillance. Usually, CCTV is most effective as an active system, with a guard monitoring the passages and another person, somewhere, watching video surveillance monitors for assistance. Everything is integrated and whatever takes place in real time.</p>
<p>Another crucial subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
