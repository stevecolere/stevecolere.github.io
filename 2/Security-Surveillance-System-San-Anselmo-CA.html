<h3>Home Security System Monitoring in California</h3>
<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month.
