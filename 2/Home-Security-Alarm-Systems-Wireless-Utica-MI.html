You might invest a similar amount for the best home security system, however they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. But, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive alternative for consumers in rural areas.
