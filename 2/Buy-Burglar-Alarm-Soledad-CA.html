<p>Thanks to recent improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you must consider the following advantages of wireless technology. The $260 Basics plan consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensor, a backyard indication, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can add around-the-clock expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy adds control by means of iOS and Android smart device apps, push and email informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for unrestricted cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is readily available independently.
