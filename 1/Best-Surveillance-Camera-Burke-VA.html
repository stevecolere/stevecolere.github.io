<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's washroom. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having problem. This is an easy switch that is normally open or usually closed.

My mind conceived a technique of not only offering the customer with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
