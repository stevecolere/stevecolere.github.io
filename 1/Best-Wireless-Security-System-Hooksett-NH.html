<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and scams. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions.
