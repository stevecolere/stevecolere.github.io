<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
