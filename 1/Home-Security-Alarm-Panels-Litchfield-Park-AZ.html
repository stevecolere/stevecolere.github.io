They're direct security cameras that mount to your wall or ceiling with a tri-axis mount (so do not fret about orienting them while you're screwing them into the wall) and focus on a specific part of your premises.

Sometimes you don't even have to hardwire them, depending upon which model you pick. Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the costlier it gets. And that cost leaps a lot when you add clever cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every smart camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
