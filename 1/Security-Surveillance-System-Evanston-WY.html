<p>Once the lights go out, the SereneLife Indoor IP Camera provides superb image quality that isn't jeopardized. For beginners, the majority of security companies do not provide business-specific alarm systems-- they just offer home security systems and equipment to businesses. So if you already safeguard your home with a security system you like, you can most likely get a similar system for your business (assuming it satisfies all your business needs, obviously).</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
