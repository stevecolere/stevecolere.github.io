As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
