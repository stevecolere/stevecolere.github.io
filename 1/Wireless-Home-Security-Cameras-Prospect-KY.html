Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
