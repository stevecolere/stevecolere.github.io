<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal construction.

Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
