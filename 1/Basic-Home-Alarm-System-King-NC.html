We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>As you start trying to find a house alarm company, there are a variety of things you require to look out for. When you're dealing with companies who install proprietary systems and claim that they just work with their licensed monitoring systems, proceed with caution.

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for usage when you're away from home, however you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming.
