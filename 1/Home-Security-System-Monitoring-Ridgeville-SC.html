Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years earlier, the home security market was controlled by a couple of big names offering expensive, stiff plans with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting agreements.
