<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense avoidance created to avoid both individual and residential or commercial property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will minimize crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a mobile phone - anytime, anywhere. Almost every security camera we took a look at supports encryption. This secures the camera's information stream (like videos of your kids after school) from prying eyes.
