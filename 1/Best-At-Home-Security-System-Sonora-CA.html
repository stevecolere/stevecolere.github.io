Given that the property owner supervises of the system, authorities are only gotten in touch with if there's a genuine emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will contact police if a homeowner can't confirm a false alarm. If  cops are called for an incorrect alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly.

Some of Google Nest's cameras do provide facial acknowledgment, but they can't trip alarms (based on whether they acknowledge somebody or otherwise).

Our systems are set so that we get your alarm signal immediately.</p>
