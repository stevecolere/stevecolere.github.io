Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you walk by.
