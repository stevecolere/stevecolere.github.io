<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was spotted. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>

The systems have adjustable electronic devices to allow installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the match particular environmental conditions.
