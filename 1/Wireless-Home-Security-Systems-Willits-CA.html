<h3>Home Security Wireless System in California</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>For the most part, wireless security equipment is only as visible as you desire it to be. Window sensing units are easily concealed behind blinds or drapes, and door sensors are so small that they tend to mix into the doorframe.
