Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
