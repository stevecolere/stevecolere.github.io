The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
