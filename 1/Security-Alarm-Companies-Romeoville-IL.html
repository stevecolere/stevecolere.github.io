<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
