<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

<p>SimpliSafe has a better-looking system than Ring, with voice prompts and assistance for Google Assistant in addition to Amazon Alexa (but not Apple HomeKit). It also has add-ons such as a video camera, a doorbell camera, smoke alarms, and extra sensing units. Unlike the Ring Alarm system, nevertheless, it doesn't offer self-monitoring alternatives or outdoor cameras; you likewise can't add any non-SimpliSafe devices, and live customer care is offered just from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern.</p>
