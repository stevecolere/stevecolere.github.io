<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas.

The Angee is short on features and huge on operating costs. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro typically showed green and pink lines across the screen; the Yi Dome Camera constantly flickered at night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a complicated app.</p>
