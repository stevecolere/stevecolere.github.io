<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas.

As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
