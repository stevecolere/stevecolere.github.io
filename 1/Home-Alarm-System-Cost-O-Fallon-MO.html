<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
