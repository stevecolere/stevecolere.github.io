<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This clever wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.
