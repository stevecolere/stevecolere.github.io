<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction.

Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
