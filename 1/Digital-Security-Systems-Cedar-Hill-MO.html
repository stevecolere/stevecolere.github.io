<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
