Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to save and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area quickly.
