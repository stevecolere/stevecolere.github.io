<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to discover what they are looking for without needing to explore hours of worthless video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective option for collecting and capturing crooks proof.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
