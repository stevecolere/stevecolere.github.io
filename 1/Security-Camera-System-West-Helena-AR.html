<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to discover what they are looking for without needing to explore hours of worthless video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective option for collecting and capturing crooks proof.</p>
<p>This will ensure that you receive a quality image. Choosing the ideal lens will allow your camera to focus and will bring enough light to the sensor on the camera, helping you to check out registration plates and recognise faces and so on Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also conserve money if you buy and install cameras by yourself. Almost all self monitored alarm systems provide protection from intrusions and break-ins in the form of motion and entry sensing units.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
