<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
