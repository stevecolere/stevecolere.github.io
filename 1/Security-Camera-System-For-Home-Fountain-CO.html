<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was discovered.

For a lot of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
