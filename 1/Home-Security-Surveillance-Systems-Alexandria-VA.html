<p>This clever wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we found it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was identified. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
