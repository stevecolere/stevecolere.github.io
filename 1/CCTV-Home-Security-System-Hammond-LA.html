<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So pick what will be the much better offer for you. If you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years, opt for the agreement and gain those savings. However if you may update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
