<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership.
