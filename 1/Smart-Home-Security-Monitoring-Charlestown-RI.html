Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
