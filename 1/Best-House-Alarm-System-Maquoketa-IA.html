Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving things if it finds an intruder; an useful intercom function that enables the device to serve as a clever doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
