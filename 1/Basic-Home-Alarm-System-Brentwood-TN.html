<p>Smoke and emergency alarm signal you if they spot a high-level of smoke or if the temperature rises too rapidly, either of which may show a fire. Most homes currently have wireless smoke or fire alarms, but you can connect the alarm to your security system to add another layer of protection that could conserve your life or residential or commercial property. If the alarm triggers when you're away from home or out of earshot, then any alarms linked to your system will inform you and the security company monitoring your home.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
