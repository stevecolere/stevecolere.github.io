So we needed to purchase new cameras.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

Salt Lake City needs verification from a private guard. A number of cities also require a license to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
