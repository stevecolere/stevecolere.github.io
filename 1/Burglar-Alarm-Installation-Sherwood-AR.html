<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an infraction. As soon as a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
