However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed homes) a costly and ineffective  technique to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
