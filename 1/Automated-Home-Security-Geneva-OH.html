<p>As you just learned, there are two broad categories of security cameras. What you typically discover at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which normally come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set. The 2nd classification of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically begins at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a substantially higher rate. The video recorder need to be acquired separately, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (United States $) and can range as much as $5000 depending upon the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing functions.</p>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet economical systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
