<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
