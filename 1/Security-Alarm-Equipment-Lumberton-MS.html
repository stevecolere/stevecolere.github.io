<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF certified, which indicates you can utilize several various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant devices.

<p>Installation is a personal choice. However, lots of systems are easy to install and do not require any circuitry. Some do not even need mounting equipment. Add a glass break detector.
