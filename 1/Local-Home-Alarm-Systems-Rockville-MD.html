The Ring Floodlight Cam combines two vital devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera spots motion, it turns on its 2 powerful LED beams in addition to its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their actions.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered.
