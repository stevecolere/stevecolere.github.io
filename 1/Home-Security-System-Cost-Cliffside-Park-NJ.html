<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Terrific clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for instance. Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
