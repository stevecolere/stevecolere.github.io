<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, vandalism, and theft. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can instantly make the wise lights turn on to frighten potential robbers.</p>

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
