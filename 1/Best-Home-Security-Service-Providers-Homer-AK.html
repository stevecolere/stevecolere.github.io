<p>The first (and most obvious, for sure) element of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are best for your system depends on your individual needs and budget; are you placing them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a large sufficient resolution?

IP cameras can likewise be linked to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and supplies power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, implying a more complex setup and more wires. PoE switches are also typically considered as a more secure method to transfer data.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it spotted any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would signal users.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue.

When choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the most significant factor to consider.
