<p>Nearly all of the latest DIY and high-end home security systems offer support for voice control by means of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and in many cases Apple Siri, which enables you to open doors, modification thermostat settings, open the garage, and arm or deactivate your system with a spoken command to a connected gadget like an Amazon Echo or a Google Home speaker. Many also provide assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That) applets, which utilize triggers from IFTTT-compatible web services and devices to produce an action.

<p>The cost of a home security system differs by provider. Some providers enable you to pick from pre-programmed equipment packages while others deal with you to develop a tailored security system.

Service providers differ in their payment structures, so it is essential to understand how you'll be anticipated to pay for your system.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
