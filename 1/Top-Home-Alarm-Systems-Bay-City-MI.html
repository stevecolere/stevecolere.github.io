<h3>Alarm Systems For Business in Bay City MI</h3>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
