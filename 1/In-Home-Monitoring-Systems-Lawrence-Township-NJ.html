<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
