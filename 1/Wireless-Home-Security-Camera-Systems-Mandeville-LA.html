<p>We needed guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to secure the line camping tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating unit at 5am. The first guard showed up early so he could take a look at the entire location and talk to me about my issues. He was professional, courteous and really reassuring. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also expert, reassuring and considerate. We were extremely delighted with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't stress when after leaving our home in your hands.</p>
