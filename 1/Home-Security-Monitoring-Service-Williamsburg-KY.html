<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
