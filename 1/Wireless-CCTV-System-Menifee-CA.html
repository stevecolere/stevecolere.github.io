Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
