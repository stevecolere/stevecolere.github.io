Disk drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems offering growth and free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand get rid of to move the data? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the best security, you desire the data to be backed up in several places. Another factor is how many days of footage are archived.
