<p>One category where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer service.

<p>Canary has actually got over some preliminary software application issues to provide a really good security camera option: particularly that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of vision, night vision and motion notifies (plus clear audio).
