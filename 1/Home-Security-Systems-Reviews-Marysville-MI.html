Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Tenants, unlike house owners, typically avoid making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other parts can easily be set up at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too.

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
