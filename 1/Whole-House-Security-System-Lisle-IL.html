<p>There are two main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern version of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little bit more expensive, they offer a variety of functions that analog cameras do not.
