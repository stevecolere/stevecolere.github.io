<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away possible robbers.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
