<p>We likewise love that Ring still has good smart home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with smart home devices like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your clever outlets with your total security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy.

You can choose from the alternatives available consisting of 2GIG control board, outdoor and indoor cameras, wise locks, and so on at varying cost, or just pay out $649 for a basic system. The hardware comes with a 3-5 year warranty and a $199 installation cost.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
