Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive method to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
