<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which indicates you can use several different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets. We believe alarm systems work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and access control.
